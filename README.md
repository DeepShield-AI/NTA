# TFE-GNN: A Temporal Fusion Encoder Using Graph Neural Networks for Fine-grained Encrypted Traffic Classification


Official implementation of the WWW'23 research paper: TFE-GNN: A Temporal Fusion Encoder Using Graph Neural Networks for Fine-grained Encrypted Traffic Classification. [[ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3543507.3583227)]

The source codes will be available soon with our incoming future work.


Note: I left this message to show that I didn't forget to open source the code. There were so many things going on during this period that I didn’t have time to calm down and sort out the code. Later, I will open source the code of the new and old work together. The new work will be a very simple but effective improvement and will appear on arxiv soon...
